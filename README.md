Github Repo for CS200 Fall 2019

## Class Description
Machine learning has recently been successfully applied to many real-world applications. In this course, we will introduce machine learning topics through hands-on interactive workshops and projects. Example topics include neural networks, computer vision models, generative models, sequential models, and reinforcement learning. This is a 1 credit, pass-fail course, so the expectation of prior knowledge and work commitment is lower than existing ML courses. Lecture time is spent evenly on workshops, coding tutorials, and working on projects.
